* add the necessary JS code to make the page work as follows:

1. the user clicks the "Add Element" button, an element is added to the div with ID "elements".
2. the HTML for the added element is as follows:

<div class="element">
    <h3>Element {some ID number here}</h3>
    <h4>This is an element</h4>
    <button>Delete</button>
</div>

3. when the user clicks the "Delete" button in an element. the entire element containing the button is deleted.
