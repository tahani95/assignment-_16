* add the necessary JS code to make the page work as follows:

1. when the user selects a valid theme from the drop-down list, the "Set Theme" button is enabled.
2. when the user selects the "Select Theme" option, the "Set Theme" button is disabled.
3. when the user clicks on the "Set Theme" button, the corresponding theme is set.

NOTES:

1. do not change any HTML or CSS. just add JS.
2. do not set the element style directly in JS. use the className or classList properties.
